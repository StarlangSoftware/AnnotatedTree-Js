# Constituency TreeBank

A treebank is a corpus where the sentences in each language are syntactically (if necessary morphologically) annotated. In the treebanks, the syntactic annotation usually follows constituent and/or dependency structure.

Treebanks annotated for the syntactic or semantic structures of the sentences are essential for developing state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems including part-of-speech-taggers, syntactic parsers, and machine translation systems. There are two main groups of syntactic treebanks, namely treebanks annotated for constituency (phrase structure) and the ones that are annotated for dependency structure.

## Data Format

We extend the original format with the relevant information, given between curly braces. For example, the word 'problem' in a sentence in the standard Penn Treebank notation, may be represented in the data format provided below:

	(NN problem)

After all levels of processing are finished, the data structure stored for the same word has the following form in the system.

	(NN {turkish=sorunu} {english=problem} 
	{morphologicalAnalysis=sorun+NOUN+A3SG+PNON+ACC}
	{metaMorphemes=sorun+yH}
	{semantics=TUR10-0703650})

As is self-explanatory, 'turkish' tag shows the original Turkish word; 'morphologicalanalysis' tag shows the correct morphological parse of that word; 'semantics' tag shows the ID of the correct sense of that word; 'namedEntity' tag shows the named entity tag of that word; 'propbank' tag shows the semantic role of that word for the verb synset id (frame id in the frame file) which is also given in that tag.
