# Constituency TreeBank

A treebank is a corpus where the sentences in each language are syntactically (if necessary morphologically) annotated. In the treebanks, the syntactic annotation usually follows constituent and/or dependency structure.

Treebanks annotated for the syntactic or semantic structures of the sentences are essential for developing state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems including part-of-speech-taggers, syntactic parsers, and machine translation systems. There are two main groups of syntactic treebanks, namely treebanks annotated for constituency (phrase structure) and the ones that are annotated for dependency structure.

## Data Format

We extend the original format with the relevant information, given between curly braces. For example, the word 'problem' in a sentence in the standard Penn Treebank notation, may be represented in the data format provided below:

	(NN problem)

After all levels of processing are finished, the data structure stored for the same word has the following form in the system.

	(NN {turkish=sorunu} {english=problem} 
	{morphologicalAnalysis=sorun+NOUN+A3SG+PNON+ACC}
	{metaMorphemes=sorun+yH}
	{semantics=TUR10-0703650})

As is self-explanatory, 'turkish' tag shows the original Turkish word; 'morphologicalanalysis' tag shows the correct morphological parse of that word; 'semantics' tag shows the ID of the correct sense of that word; 'namedEntity' tag shows the named entity tag of that word; 'propbank' tag shows the semantic role of that word for the verb synset id (frame id in the frame file) which is also given in that tag.

Detailed Description
============

+ [TreeBankDrawable](#treebankdrawable)
+ [ParseTreeDrawable](#parsetreedrawable)
+ [LayerInfo](#layerinfo)

## TreeBankDrawable

To load an annotated TreeBank:

	TreeBankDrawable(folder: string, pattern: string)
	a = new TreeBankDrawable("/Turkish-Phrase", ".train")

To access all the trees in a TreeBankDrawable:

	for (let i = 0; i < a.sentenceCount(); i++){
		let parseTree = <ParseTreeDrawable> a.get(i);
		....
	}

## ParseTreeDrawable

To load a saved ParseTreeDrawable:

	ParseTreeDrawable(file: string)
	
is used. Usually it is more useful to load TreeBankDrawable as explained above than to load ParseTree one by one.

To find the node number of a ParseTreeDrawable:

	 nodeCount(): number
	
the leaf number of a ParseTreeDrawable:

	leafCount(): number
	
the word count in a ParseTreeDrawable:

	wordCount(excludeStopWords: boolean): number
	
above methods can be used.

## LayerInfo

Information of an annotated word is kept in LayerInfo class. To access the morphological analysis
of the annotated word:

	getMorphologicalParseAt(index: number): MorphologicalParse

meaning of an annotated word:

	getSemanticAt(index: number): string

the shallow parse tag (e.g., subject, indirect object etc.) of annotated word: 

	getShallowParseAt(index: number): string

the argument tag of the annotated word:

	getArgumentAt(index: number): Argument
	
the word count in a node:

	getNumberOfWords(): number

For Contibutors
============

### package.json file

1. main and types are important when this package will be imported.
```
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
```
2. Dependencies should be maximum (not only direct but also indirect references should also be given), everything directly in the code should be given here.
```
  "dependencies": {
    "nlptoolkit-corpus": "^1.0.12",
    "nlptoolkit-dictionary": "^1.0.14",
    "nlptoolkit-morphologicalanalysis": "^1.0.19",
    "nlptoolkit-xmlparser": "^1.0.7"
  }
```

### tsconfig.json file

1. Compiler flags currently includes nodeNext for importing.
```
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "module": "nodeNext",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "declaration": true,
  },
```
2. tests, node_modules and dist should be excluded.
```
  "exclude": [
    "tests",
    "node_modules",
    "dist"
  ]
```

### index.ts file

1. Should include all ts classes.
```
export * from "./CategoryType"
export * from "./InterlingualDependencyType"
export * from "./InterlingualRelation"
export * from "./Literal"
```

### Data files
1. Add data files to the project folder. Subprojects should include all data files of the parent projects.

### Javascript files

1. Classes should be defined as exported.
```
export class JCN extends ICSimilarity{
```
2. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
    /**
     * Computes JCN wordnet similarity metric between two synsets.
     * @param synSet1 First synset
     * @param synSet2 Second synset
     * @return JCN wordnet similarity metric between two synsets
     */
    computeSimilarity(synSet1: SynSet, synSet2: SynSet): number {
```
3. Function names should follow caml case.
```
    setSynSetId(synSetId: string){
```
4. Write getter and setter methods.
```
    getRelation(index: number): Relation{
    setName(name: string){
```
5. Use standard javascript test style.
```
describe('SimilarityPathTest', function() {
    describe('SimilarityPathTest', function() {
        it('testComputeSimilarity', function() {
            let turkish = new WordNet();
            let similarityPath = new SimilarityPath(turkish);
            assert.strictEqual(32.0, similarityPath.computeSimilarity(turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0656390"), turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0600460")));
            assert.strictEqual(13.0, similarityPath.computeSimilarity(turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0412120"), turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0755370")));
            assert.strictEqual(13.0, similarityPath.computeSimilarity(turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0195110"), turkish.getSynSetWithId("TUR10-0822980")));
        });
    });
});
```
6. Enumerated types should be declared with enum.
```
export enum CategoryType {
    MATHEMATICS, SPORT, MUSIC, SLANG, BOTANIC,
    PLURAL, MARINE, HISTORY, THEOLOGY, ZOOLOGY,
    METAPHOR, PSYCHOLOGY, ASTRONOMY, GEOGRAPHY, GRAMMAR,
    MILITARY, PHYSICS, PHILOSOPHY, MEDICAL, THEATER,
    ECONOMY, LAW, ANATOMY, GEOMETRY, BUSINESS,
    PEDAGOGY, TECHNOLOGY, LOGIC, LITERATURE, CINEMA,
    TELEVISION, ARCHITECTURE, TECHNICAL, SOCIOLOGY, BIOLOGY,
    CHEMISTRY, GEOLOGY, INFORMATICS, PHYSIOLOGY, METEOROLOGY,
    MINERALOGY
}
```
7. If there are multiple constructors for a class, define them as constructor1, constructor2, ..., then from the original constructor call these methods.
```
    constructor1(symbol: any){
    constructor2(symbol: any, multipleFile: MultipleFile) {
    constructor(symbol: any, multipleFile: MultipleFile = undefined) {
        if (multipleFile == undefined){
            this.constructor1(symbol);
        } else {
            this.constructor2(symbol, multipleFile);
        }
    }
```
8. Importing should be done via import method with referencing the node-modules.
```
import {Corpus} from "nlptoolkit-corpus/dist/Corpus";
import {Sentence} from "nlptoolkit-corpus/dist/Sentence";
```
9. Use xmlparser package for parsing xml files.
```
	var doc = new XmlDocument("test.xml")
	doc.parse()
	let root = doc.getFirstChild()
	let firstChild = root.getFirstChild()
```
